This is a demo that uses the Adafruit_GFX library to control the MAIX GO LCD screen.
It has been assembled from various sources:
- Adafruit
- Arduino
- Maixpy

I tried to leave the Adafruit and Arduino stuff as close to the original as possible. 

See the notes in the README.md in the root of this repository.
